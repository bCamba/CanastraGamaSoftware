The objective of the software is to display real-time data received from the ground station.

The ground station is an arduino-based system that is used to collect and save data from the CanSat and also transmits data
to the software.

Data to be received by the software:
- Team ID
- External Temperature
- Internal Temperature
- External Luminosity
- External Pressure
- GPS Latitude
- GPS Longitude
- GPS Elevation
- GPS Timestamp

Data to be displayed by the software:

- 3D Trajectory
- Distance x Time
- Speed x Time
- Acceleration x Time
- External Pressure x Time
- External Pressure x Altitude
- External Luminosity x Time
- External Luminosity x Altitude
- Internal Temperature x Time
- Internal Temperature x Altitude
- External Temperature x Time
- External Temeprature x Altitude


The software system will be implemented using the Processing 3 language.
